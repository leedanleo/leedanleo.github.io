                I utilized three classification machine learning algorithms to classify based on 24 attributes if a
                person were to default on their credit card statements. The three classification methods used
                were deep learning neural networks and na√Øve Bayes. The deep learning neural network was
                able to predict at an accuracy of 85 percent without information on salary and was restricted
                to one geographical region.

                This a website that is built on react to be able show people in the portland places to play amateur sports. Currently the 
                site has volleyball, basketball, and tennis. This application uses the google maps api to set locations in the area. The rendering for
                application is chosen based on sport and day of the week the gyms/locations are available that week. This application is designed in hopes that all 
                the sports in the portland area can be consolidated in one area.

                I developed a portfolio website that showcases my education, work experience, art gallery, projects, and activities. 
                The website utilizes bootstrap as the front-end framework. The website is deployed by github's free website service. The website is to showcase
                my abilities using CSS, HTML, and Javascript.

                I developed a front-end application of a recipe book that can store recipes by uploading
                images of the recipe and read out the full recipe to the vision impaired. The application
                utilizes google cloud machine learning APIs in vision and text to speech and was deployed to
                the cloud using the google cloud platform.

                I have developed and deployed a database on the Microsoft Azure SQL database system. The
                goal of the project was to expand my experience utilizing cloud databases as well as test the
                speed and quality of the database utilizing the Wisconsin benchmark. The input data was
                produced using python and was fed into the database to test the benchmarks at multiple data
                loads against local Postgres. The test was done by querying heavy compute data stores such
                as full merge sort queries.
